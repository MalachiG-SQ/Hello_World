# Hello World Project

This project is being able test an API with Node.js and Express to call an API that returns the name with "Hello" in front of it. 

## Purpose

I wanted to create a project using Node.js, Express and JS that calls to an API and returns the value to the frontend HTML. This asks the user for their input (Name) and displays it with the following: Hello "Name". 

I wanted to try being able to catch errors as well. I have it that if the characters are > 50, return "Name is too long" or if the user only uses numbers, it returns "Please enter at least one non-numeric character"
